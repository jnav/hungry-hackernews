=================

Very simple PHP script which adds link to each article. Link behaves as "Instapaper Text Bookmarklet". In other words - you will get pretty formated article + you save on bandwidth

# Who would use such thing?  #

Someone like me :-) Going every day to work and reading Hacker News is fun. Avoiding advertisments and useless text which doesn't relate to article + saving on bandwidth is a good thing.. 

# Requirements #
* curl enabled hosting
* write permission on filesystem

# Installation #

Just place this script into your DocumentRoot and call it from browser!
