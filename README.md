Hungry Hacker News (on diet)
=================

This very simple PHP script add link to each HN article. Link behaves as "Instapaper Text Bookmarklet". In other words - you will get pretty formated article + you save on bandwidth.

With this script I can read HN articles even when on GPRS and as a bonus I have each page nicely formated

## Who would use such thing?

Someone like me :-) Going every day to work and reading Hacker News is fun. Avoiding advertisments and useless text which doesn't relate to article + saving on bandwidth is even better :-)
