Hungry Hacker News (on diet)
=================

This very simple PHP script add link to each HN article. Link behaves as "Instapaper Text Bookmarklet". In other words - you will get pretty formated article + you save on bandwidth.

With this script I can read HN articles even when on GPRS and as a bonus I have each page nicely formated

## Who would use such thing?

Someone like me :-) Going every day to work and reading Hacker News is fun. Avoiding advertisments and useless text which doesn't relate to article + saving on bandwidth is even better :-)

## Requirements
* curl enabled hosting
* write permission on filesystem

## Installation

Just place this script into your DocumentRoot and call it from browser!

## Screenshot

each article has [ TXT ] link which leads to Instapaper (no account required!)

## Last word

Don't forget to support Instapaper for all that heavy lifting!
